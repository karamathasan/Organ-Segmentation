# Organ-Segmentation
## Procedure
Using CT scans from the [Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/access-data/) and MONAI's [Wholebody Segmentation model](https://monai.io/model-zoo.html), we can view segmented organ voxels in a CT scan.
Given the segmentations, we can find the the volumes of specific strucures. Here, I find the volumes of the liver, bladder, as well as the heart and its chambers.
